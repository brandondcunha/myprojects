<b>Introduction:</b><br>
The main aim of our project is to develop a crop monitoring system to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture and water level with the help of various sensors for chili crops. With the help of WSN we can implement this system which will reduce the cost of the entire system and assist the farmer with real time data gathering. The system consists of sensors, nodes, data gathering station, gateway, storage, reporting-solution and a man-computer exchange interface. The farmer need not go to the farmland and keep check of the environmental condition manually whereas he can be present in any corner of the world and still able to understand the changing conditions in his farmland and take any measures required to get a better yield of the crop. <br>
The monitoring system can be implemented by using wires to connect the different components. This will make the measuring system expensive, vulnerable and measurement points will be difficult to locate in a big field. The WSN system consists of small sensors, nodes and a gateway which is cost efficient and practically easy to build and maintain. These sensors will be deployed at various places on the field which will be gathering data throughout the day and routing it to the gateway. The whole system will be powered by a battery which will make it independent of an external source power supply. The batteries will be recharged with the help of solar- panels which will be connected to the battery. <br>
The collected data from the WSN system will be uploaded to an online database. The website and the android application will be connected to this database from which data will be extracted, 
further processed and will be displayed to the users. The android app will also notify any shortcomings the crop is facing by providing live update notifications to the user.
